# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).


# IMPORTANT NOTE: Seed file was replaced by rake tasks.
# Please see task rails_insights:seed:all in lib/tasks/rails_insights/seed.rake for more details.
